# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Outfit.destroy_all
# print "seeding"

# Outfit_king_S = Outfit.create(name:"king", color:"blue, yellow, gold", pet:"dog", size:"S", price:30, style: "fun")
# Outfit_king_M = Outfit.create(name:"king", color:"blue, yellow, gold", pet:"dog", size:"M", price:40, style: "fun")
# Outfit_king_L = Outfit.create(name:"king", color:"blue, yellow, gold", pet:"dog", size:"L", price:50, style: "fun")

# Outfit_tux_S = Outfit.create(name:"tux", color:"black, white", pet:"dog", size:"S", price:35, style: "smart")
# Outfit_tux_M = Outfit.create(name:"tux", color:"black, white", pet:"dog", size:"M", price:45, style: "smart")
# Outfit_tux_L = Outfit.create(name:"tux", color:"black, white", pet:"dog", size:"L", price:55, style: "smart")
